# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to help one of BigMarketâ€™s clients, SellBy to optimize their marketing efforts. Using PySpark, one dataset out of 50 was chosen to perform the ETL process to extract, transforsform the data, connect it to AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. PySpark was then used to determine whether there was any bias towards more successful reviews from Vine members from the dataset.
